FDM Material Properties and Application Logic: A Technical Database

This report provides a comprehensive database and technical analysis of common and specialty Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) filaments. The data is structured to populate a material recommendation engine, adhering to the schema provided in material_db.csv 1 and expanding it to include all requested materials.
The analysis is segmented into three parts:
	•	A Technical Primer establishing the core material science principles that must govern the recommendation engine's logic.
	•	Master Material Databases containing quantitative and qualitative data for direct ingestion.
	•	A Technical Dossier on specialty filaments and application-specific "guardrails" required for an expert-level recommendation system.

A Technical Primer for the Material Recommendation Engine

A successful recommendation engine must function as a domain expert, guiding users away from common pitfalls. The following principles are foundational to the application's filtering logic, particularly for the "Guided Selection Wizard" and "MCDM Ranker" features.1

The Anisotropic Reality of FDM: A Prerequisite for Functional Design

Fused Deposition Modeling is an inherently anisotropic manufacturing process. This means the mechanical properties of a printed part are not uniform in all directions, a critical concept that must be central to the application's logic.2
Part strength is fundamentally bifurcated:
	•	XY-Axis (In-plane) Strength: This is dictated by the continuous extruded polymer. It represents the material's maximum potential strength.
	•	Z-Axis (Build Direction) Strength: This is dictated by interlayer adhesion—the quality of the thermal weld between subsequent layers. This bond is the part's weakest link.4
The tensile strength in the Z-axis is typically a fraction of the XY-axis strength. This reduction is commonly 40-60% 1, with some academic studies showing a 50-75% decrease in tensile strength 5 or a 4-5x difference in functional strength.4
This anisotropic behavior directly informs the logic for the "Global Load-Direction Toggle".1 A part loaded in tension along its Z-axis (e.g., a vertically printed hook) is predisposed to delamination and catastrophic failure. When this toggle is set to "Z-Axis Load," the application's ranking system must exclusively use the Strength_Z_MPa data. Furthermore, a "guardrail" warning 1 should advise the user to re-orient their part for printing, aligning the critical stress direction with the XY plane for maximum strength. This report provides data for both Strength_XY_MPa and Strength_Z_MPa to enable this critical feature.

A Framework for Mechanical Properties (The "MCDM Ranker" Metrics)

Novice users often conflate "strength," "stiffness," and "toughness." The "Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) Ranker" 1 must help users navigate the trade-offs between these distinct properties.
	•	Strength (Ultimate Tensile Strength, MPa): The maximum static pulling force a material can withstand before it breaks.6
	•	Stiffness (Tensile Modulus, MPa): A measure of rigidity; the material's resistance to elastic deformation (flexing) under load. A high-modulus part is stiff; a low-modulus part is flexible.6
	•	Toughness (Impact Resistance, kJ/m²): A measure of energy absorption; the material's ability to resist sudden impact or shock without shattering.1
The "PLA vs. PETG" trade-off is the canonical example. A user ranking only for "Strength" and "Stiffness" will find PLA (Strength $\approx$ 65 MPa; Modulus $\approx$ 2800 MPa) ranks higher than PETG (Strength $\approx$ 49 MPa; Modulus $\approx$ 1913 MPa).1 However, PLA is brittle (Toughness $\approx$ 7 kJ/m²) while PETG is exceptionally tough (Toughness $\approx$ 10.5 kJ/m²).1 PLA fails like glass; PETG fails like metal, by deforming first.9 The application must guide a user seeking "durability" (Toughness) toward PETG, TPU, or PC, even if their "Strength" scores are lower.

Understanding Long-Term Performance: Creep, Fatigue, and Environment

	•	Creep: This property, represented by the Prone_to_Creep flag 1, is the tendency of a material to deform permanently under persistent mechanical stress. PLA is highly susceptible to creep.1 A PLA shelf bracket, though strong enough to hold a book, will slowly sag and fail over months. PETG, ABS, ASA, and PC are significantly more resistant.11 The "Guided Selection Wizard" 1 must filter out any material where Prone_to_Creep is true if the user selects an application like "structural part under constant load."
	•	Hygroscopicity: The Hygroscopic flag 1 is critical for printability. Many engineering polymers (Nylon, PC, PETG, PVA, PVB) readily absorb moisture from the air.1 Printing "wet" filament causes steam, bubbles, and poor layer adhesion, dramatically reducing mechanical properties. Polypropylene (PP) is a notable exception, being non-hygroscopic.14
	•	UV Resistance: The UV_Resistant flag 1 is essential for outdoor applications. PLA and ABS will degrade, crack, and discolor under UV exposure.15 The primary material for this application is ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate), which was designed as a UV-resistant alternative to ABS.16 PETG and PC also offer good UV resistance.17

Master Material Database (Quantitative Properties)

The following tables populate the provided schema with synthesized data from technical data sheets (TDS) and industry reports. Where Z-axis strength data was not explicitly provided in a TDS, it is estimated at 45% of XY-axis strength for amorphous polymers (e.g., PLA, PETG, ABS) and 50% for semi-crystalline (e.g., Nylon), reflecting typical interlayer adhesion strength values.

Table 2: Physical and Economic Properties (Expanded material_db.csv)

This table provides the necessary data for the "cost per cm³" calculation feature.1 A simple Cost_Score based on price per kilogram is misleading. Materials must be compared by cost per volume.
The calculation is:
$Cost_{per\_cm^3} = (Price_{USD\_per\_kg} / 1000) * Density_{g\_cm^3}$
For example, Polypropylene (PP) has a high price per kilogram ($\approx$ $40) but is one of the cheapest materials by volume due to its 0.9 g/cm³ density. Conversely, Metal-filled PLA ($\approx$ $60/kg) appears affordable but is one of the most expensive materials by volume due to its 3.0 g/cm³ density.31

Technical Dossier: Specialty & Composite Materials

This section provides the "expert notes" for the specialty materials requested in the query, analyzing their unique properties and the trade-offs that the recommendation engine must communicate.

Aesthetic & Filled Filaments (PLA Variants)

A primary finding is that all PLA-based aesthetic filaments (Wood, Silk, Metal-fill, Glow-in-the-dark) are weaker and more brittle than their base PLA. The additives act as impurities, disrupting polymer chain bonding and creating stress concentration points.
	•	PLA (Standard) Strength: $\approx$ 65 MPa 1
	•	Wood-PLA Strength: $\approx$ 26 MPa 24
	•	Silk-PLA Strength: $\approx$ 26 MPa 25
	•	Glow-in-the-dark-PLA Strength: $\approx$ 32 MPa 29
	•	Metal-PLA Strength: $\approx$ 34 MPa 28
The application must cluster these materials as "Aesthetic" or "Low-Strength Visual" and not recommend them for functional or structural parts.
	•	Glow-in-the-dark (GITD) PLA: The glowing additive (strontium aluminate) is extremely abrasive.45 This is a hardware-gated material. A standard brass nozzle can be destroyed, often within a single print, leading to failure and dimensional inaccuracy.49 The application's "Guided Wizard" 1 must ask, "Do you have a hardened steel nozzle?".42 If false, all GITD, Carbon Fiber, and Metal-Filled filaments must be flagged as "Incompatible."
	•	Metal-Filled PLA: These filaments (e.g., bronze-fill, copper-fill) are PLA mixed with a high percentage of metal powder.32 This creates parts that are very heavy (density 2-4 g/cm³) 31 and can be polished for a metallic appearance. They are not functional metal; they are brittle composites 51 and are also highly abrasive.42 This must be distinguished from "sinterable" metal filaments, which require extensive furnace post-processing to become fully metal.50

Functional Polymers (PET & PP)

	•	PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate): This is the base polymer of PETG. New PET formulations (e.g., eSUN PET) are marketed as high-performance alternatives, offering higher heat resistance (HDT up to 80°C) and higher flexural strength (90-100 MPa) than standard PETG.22 It prints at higher temperatures (250-280°C) 22 and should be clustered with "Engineering" materials as a step above PETG.
	•	PP (Polypropylene): This material presents extreme trade-offs.
	•	Pros: Exceptional chemical resistance to a wide range of acids and bases 8, high fatigue resistance (ideal for "living hinges") 8, and an extremely low density (0.9 g/cm³).14 It is also non-hygroscopic.14
	•	Cons: It is extremely difficult to print. It has a high, non-uniform shrinkage rate, leading to severe warping.27 It has poor adhesion and requires a specialized build plate (often a sheet of PP plastic).14 This material should have a Printability_Score of 1 and be recommended only to experts.

Support & Post-Processing Filaments (PVA & PVB)

	•	PVA (Polyvinyl Alcohol): This material's sole purpose is as a water-soluble support material.26 It is mechanically weak, expensive, and exceptionally hygroscopic.26 Its primary data points are compatibility. It bonds well to PLA, PETG, and Nylon 26 but not to ABS or CPE.26 This is a critical constraint for multi-material printing.
	•	PVB (Polyvinyl Butyral): This is an aesthetic material whose primary feature is solubility in Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA).58 Unlike hazardous Acetone smoothing for ABS, IPA smoothing is relatively safe and easy, melting the outer layer to erase layer lines and create a smooth, glossy, or transparent finish.61 It is not a functional material; it has low layer-to-layer adhesion 13 and temperature resistance similar to PLA.13

Hardware, Process, and Application Dependencies (The "Guided Wizard" Logic)

The 2024-2025 FDM printer market is defined by a technological bifurcation that creates a clear, two-tier hardware-material map.40 The recommendation engine's "Guided Wizard" 1 must use this logic as its primary filter.

The Hardware-Material Link: A Critical Filter

	•	Tier 1 (Budget/Beginner): These printers (e.g., Creality Ender 3 V3 SE) typically feature PTFE-lined hotends (Max Temp $\approx$ 260°C) and no enclosure.40 They are hardware-locked to low-temperature, low-warping materials.
	•	Compatible Materials: PLA, PETG, TPU.
	•	Incompatible Materials: ABS, ASA, PC, Nylon, PP, and all high-temperature composites.
	•	Tier 2 (Prosumer/Professional): These printers (e.g., Bambu Lab X1C, Creality K1C, Prusa Core One) feature all-metal hotends (Max Temp 300-350°C), hardened nozzle options, and enclosed (often heated) chambers.40
	•	Compatible Materials: All Tier 1 materials.
	•	Unlocked Materials: ABS, ASA, PC, Nylon, PP, and all Carbon Fiber/Glass Fiber composites.
The first question in the "Guided Wizard" 1 should be about the user's hardware. Based on their answers, the application must filter the material list.

Multi-Material Systems & Material (In)compatibility

The term "multi-material" is ambiguous and has two distinct technological paths.40
	•	Path A: Single-Nozzle Switcher (e.g., Bambu AMS, Creality CFS): These systems are for aesthetic multi-color printing.40 They are mechanically incompatible with flexible (TPU) and abrasive (CF) filaments.65 They also generate significant filament waste from purging.63
	•	Path B: Toolchanger / IDEX (e.g., Prusa XL): These systems are for true multi-material engineering.40 They have no material constraints and are the only systems that can print a rigid part (PLA) with a flexible gasket (TPU) and a soluble support (PVA) in a single job.40
The application must ask, "What multi-material system are you using?" If AMS/CFS is selected, the application must block any attempt to combine PLA + TPU and display a warning.

Post-Processing for Performance & Aesthetics

	•	Annealing (The Annealable_for_HDT flag): Annealing is a post-print heat treatment (e.g., in an oven) that increases crystallinity.67 For HTPLA, this process transforms the material, boosting its Heat_Resistance_HDT_C from a PLA-like 58°C to over 150°C.1 The application must display two HDT values for such materials: "HDT (As-Printed)" and "HDT (Annealed)."
	•	Vapor Smoothing: This process uses chemical solvents to melt a part's surface, erasing layer lines.60 The application should list this as a feature and filter by the required solvent:
	•	Acetone: ABS, ASA 70
	•	Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA): PVB 59
	•	Limonene: HIPS 41

Special Application Dossiers (The "Guardrails")

	•	Application: "Food Safe" Printing: This is the most critical guardrail. Users believe "food-safe filament" equals "food-safe part." This is false and dangerous.73
	•	The Problem:
	•	Layer Lines: The micro-voids and crevices between FDM layers are impossible to clean and become breeding grounds for bacteria.75
	•	Hardware Contamination: Standard brass nozzles, which are common, can contain lead and are not food-safe.73
	•	The Solution: The application must not have a simple "Food Safe: Yes/No" filter. If a user selects "Food Contact," the app must:
	•	Recommend filaments with FDA-compliant raw resins (e.g., specific brands of natural PETG, PP).75
	•	Display a mandatory warning: "Printed parts are not food-safe due to layer lines and potential nozzle contamination. For food-contact applications, you MUST use a stainless steel nozzle and apply a certified food-safe coating (e.g., ArtResin, Masterbond EP42HT-2FG) to seal the part".77
	•	Application: "Chemical Resistance": This is not a binary. The Chemical_Resistant property (Table 3) is a 0-3 scale.
	•	Level 0 (Poor): PLA (vulnerable).
	•	Level 1 (Limited): PETG (resists water, salts, weak acids/bases).6
	•	Level 2 (Good): ABS, ASA (resists oils, alcohols).37
	•	Level 3 (Excellent): PP (resists a wide range of acids and bases) 14; PVDF, PEEK, PPSU (resists aggressive organic solvents, strong acids, halogens).37
